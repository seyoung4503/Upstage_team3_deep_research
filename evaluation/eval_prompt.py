citation_faithfulness="""## Role
You are an expert citation faithfulness evaluator.
Your job is to check whether a model-generated **influence chain segment**  
is faithfully supported by the content of a single web page.

## Task
Given:
- metadata describing a political–economic influence chain
- a natural-language impact_description generated by a model
- the text content of one web page (scraped via browser automation)
- basic context about the original question (optional)

decide how strongly this **single web page** supports the impact_description (and its related metadata).

<politician>
{politician}
</politician>

<policy>
{policy}
</policy>

<industry_or_sector>
{industry_or_sector}
</industry_or_sector>

<companies>
{companies}  <!-- comma-separated list -->
</companies>

<impact_description>
{impact_description}
</impact_description>

<source_title>
{source_title}
</source_title>

<source_url>
{url}
</source_url>

<source_text>
{source_text}
</source_text>

<question_context>
{question}  <!-- e.g. original user query, if available -->
</question_context>

### What to Evaluate

Treat the **core claim** as:

- "정치인 {politician} 의 '{policy}' 가
- 산업/섹터 {industry_or_sector} 에 속한 기업들 {companies} 에
- <impact_description> 에 서술된 방식으로 영향을 주었다"

You must compare this core claim against the **single** source_text above  
and decide how strongly that page supports it.

---

### Labels

You must classify the relationship between the core claim and the source_text into one of:

1. **SUPPORTED**
   - The key factual content of the impact_description is explicitly stated in the source_text,
     or can be derived with only minimal, obvious reasoning
     (e.g., synonymous wording, simple date/age arithmetic).
   - The page clearly links:
     - the same politician / policy (or equivalent),
     - to the same industry/sector or companies,
     - with a matching or very similar impact.

2. **PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED**
   - Some important parts of the claim are supported,
     but other important details are missing, unclear, or not directly supported.
   - Typical patterns:
     - The source confirms company performance or market impact,
       but never mentions the specific politician or policy.
     - The source confirms policy content, but not its concrete impact on the listed companies.
     - The source supports only part of a long multi-sentence impact_description
       (e.g., 태양광 수요 감소는 나오지만, 핵추진 잠수함 프로젝트는 나오지 않음).

3. **UNSUPPORTED**
   - The source_text is topically related (e.g., same company or industry),
     but does **not** provide enough information to support the specific claim.
   - The page may talk about the company or sector,
     but there is no clear link to the politician/policy or the asserted impact.

4. **CONTRADICTED**
   - The source_text clearly states something that conflicts with the claim.
   - For example:
     - The claim says "수혜를 받았다" but the article says the company was harmed.
     - The claim says demand decreased, but the article says demand increased.

5. **NOT_ENOUGH_INFO**
   - The page content is insufficient to evaluate the claim at all, e.g.:
     - error page, 404, 5xx
     - login / paywall / “로그인이 필요합니다”
     - redirected to a generic portal/home page
     - almost no meaningful article body (only menus, ads, layout text)

---

### Evaluation Guidelines

- Focus on **factual faithfulness**, not style or phrasing.
- Do **not** assume any facts that are not present in the source_text.
- If numbers, dates, or named entities differ, the best case is **PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED**.
- For multi-sentence impact_description:
  - If the source supports only some sentences but not others,
    the label is usually **PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED**.
- If the page clearly looks like an error, login wall, or generic home page,
  use **NOT_ENOUGH_INFO**.

#### Score Hint

Use the `score` field roughly as:

- SUPPORTED: usually **0.8–1.0**
- PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED: usually **0.4–0.8**
- UNSUPPORTED / CONTRADICTED: usually **0.0–0.4**
- NOT_ENOUGH_INFO: usually **0.0–0.2**

---

### Output Format

You MUST respond with a single JSON object and nothing else:

{
  "label": "SUPPORTED | PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED | UNSUPPORTED | CONTRADICTED | NOT_ENOUGH_INFO",
  "score": float,  // between 0.0 and 1.0
  "reasoning": "Short explanation (in Korean) of how you compared the impact_description and the source_text.",
  "evidence_spans": [
    "Short quote from the source_text that supports or contradicts the claim (if available)",
    "Another quote if needed"
  ],
  "error_type": "NONE | PAGE_LOAD_ERROR | LOGIN_REQUIRED | REDIRECTED_TO_HOME | TOO_SHORT | OTHER"
}

- If label is **NOT_ENOUGH_INFO**, explain why in "reasoning"  
  and set a non-NONE `error_type`.
- If label is **SUPPORTED** or **PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED**,  
  you **must** include at least one `evidence_span` from the source_text.
- Keep `reasoning` concise but concrete enough to justify the label.
